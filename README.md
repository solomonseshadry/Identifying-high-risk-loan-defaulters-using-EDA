# Loan Risk Analysis for lendingclub.com
 A case study for the consumer finance company lendingclub.com where we dive into understand what factors determine a loan defaulter in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.

### Business Objectives :

This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

### Types of Risks :

The are 2 types of risks are associated with the Bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

We have the data that contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
